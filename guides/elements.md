# Elements

## Overview

Elements are reusable blocks of content that belong together, visually and contextually.

Imagine you combine a headline, a text block and a picture - this is a typical element, maybe you want to call it an "article".

Some people speak of widgets, blocks or components. All these are elements in Alchemy. Elements can be nested into each other and are the key of Alchemy's flexible content architecture.

They give you a powerful tool to build the CMS you need.

The ingredients of an element are of a specific [type](ingredients). Each ingredient represents a data type that store values in the database.

## Templates

Each element has a template (they are called [partials in Rails](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/layouts_and_rendering.html#using-partials)).

They live in `app/views/alchemy/elements/`.

::: tip NOTE
You don't need to create the files yourself. Use [the built in generator](#generating-the-partials) to let Alchemy generate them for you.
:::

## Defining elements

Elements are defined in the `config/alchemy/elements.yml` file. Element definitions are written in [YAML](http://yaml.org)

If this file does not exist yet, use the scaffold generator to do that now:

~~~ bash
bin/rails g alchemy:install
~~~

The generator also creates all the other basic folders and files for setting up your website with Alchemy.

::: warning NOTE
The element definitions are cached. Please restart the server after editing the `elements.yml`.
:::

### Example element definition

~~~ yaml
# config/alchemy/elements.yml
- name: article
  unique: true
  ingredients:
    - role: image
      type: Picture
    - role: headline
      type: Text
      as_element_title: true
    - role: copy
      type: Richtext
~~~

The element in this example is named **"article"** and can be placed only once per page (because it is `unique`). It has three ingredients of the following types:

* [Picture](ingredients.html#picture)
* [Text](ingredients.html#text)
* [Richtext](ingredients.html#richtext)

::: tip
You can select which ingredient will be used for the preview text in the element's title bar in the admin frontend by adding `as_element_title: true` to the desired ingredient. In the example above, the **"headline"** ingredient would be used.
:::

### Element settings

The following settings can be used to define elements in the `elements.yml`.

* **name** `String` _required_

  A lowercased **unique** name of the element. Separate words need to be underscored. The name is used in the `page_layouts.yml` file to define on which pages the element can be used. It is also part of the `app/views/alchemy/elements` view partials file names. The name is [translatable](#translating-elements) for the user in the admin frontend.

* **unique** `Boolean` (Default: `false`)

  Passing `true` means this element can be placed only once on a page.

* **hint** `String`

  A hint for the user in the admin interface that should be used to describe what the element is used for. The hint is [translatable](#translating-elements) if you provide an I18n translation key instead of a complete sentence. The hint itself will be displayed as a small question mark icon and will reveal a tooltip once hovered by the user.

* **message** `String`

  A prominent informational message displayed at the top of the element editor form in the admin interface that can be used to give your user additional information. You can even use simple html to add some emphasis to your message.

* **warning** `String`

  A prominent warning message displayed at the top of the element editor form in the admin interface that can be used to warn your user about something. You can use simple html to add even more emphasis to your warning.

* **nestable_elements** `Array`

  A collection of element names that can be nested into the element.

* **taggable** `Boolean` (Default: `false`)

  Enables the element to be taggable by the user in the admin frontend.

* **fixed** `Boolean` (Default: `false`)

  Used to separate an element from the normal flow. When `true`, the element is rendered on the page only with the explicit call of the `fixed_elements` scope. See [fixed elements](elements.html#render-a-group-of-elements-on-a-fixed-place-on-the-page) for more details.

* **ingredients** `Array`

  A collection of ingredients the element contains. A ingredient has to have a `role` (unique per element) and a `type`.

::: tip
Have a look at the [ingredients guide](ingredients) to get more informations about available ingredient types.
:::

In the following examples you will see how to use these settings.

## Nestable elements

You are able to nest elements into other elements.

Just define nestable elements in your `elements.yml` file.

### Example

~~~ yaml
- name: article
  ingredients:
    - role: headline
      type: Text
  nestable_elements:
    - text
    - picture

- name: text
  ingredients:
    - role: text
      type: Richtext

- name: picture
  ingredients:
    - role: text
      type: Picture
~~~

::: warning NOTE
Nested elements can also have `nestable_elements`. Just don't get too crazy with it, though.
:::

## Rendering nested elements

Use the `render` helper to render all nested elements as a collection.

~~~ erb
<%= element_view_for(article) do |el| %>
  <h3><%= el.render :headline %></h3>

  <div class="text-blocks">
    <%= render article.nested_elements %>
  </div>
<% end %>
~~~

Or `render` a group of nested elements by filtering the `nested_elements` collection by element name.

~~~ erb
<%= element_view_for(article) do |el| %>
  <h3><%= el.render :headline %></h3>

  <div class="text-blocks">
    <%= render article.nested_elements.named(:text) %>
  </div>

  <div class="pictures">
    <%= render article.nested_elements.named(:picture) %>
  </div>
<% end %>
~~~

Or `render` a single nested element by loading it from the `nested_elements` collection by element name.

~~~ erb
<%= element_view_for(article) do |el| %>
  <h3><%= el.render :headline %></h3>

  <div class="picture">
    <%= render article.nested_elements.find_by(name: :picture) %>
  </div>

  <div class="text-blocks">
    <%= render article.nested_elements.where(name: :text) %>
  </div>
<% end %>
~~~

## Element with tags

Elements are taggable. To enable it, add `taggable: true` to the element's definition.

~~~ yaml
- name: article
  taggable: true
  ingredients:
    - role: image
      type: Picture
    - role: headline
      type: Text
      as_element_title: true
    - role: copy
      type: Richtext
~~~

Tags are a collection on the `element` object. `element.tag_list` returns an array of tag names.

~~~ erb
<%= element.tag_list.join(', ') %>
~~~

Alchemy uses the [gutentag](https://github.com/pat/gutentag) gem, so please refer to the github [README](https://github.com/pat/gutentag/blob/master/README.md) or the [Wiki](https://github.com/pat/gutentag/wiki) for further informations.

## Element with ingredient validations

You can enable validations for your ingredients. They behave like the Rails model validations.

Supported validations are

* `presence`
* `uniqueness`
* `format`

The `format` validator needs to have a [regular expression](http://rubular.com) or a predefined matcher string as its value.

There are already predefined format matchers listed in the `config/alchemy/config.yml` file.

It is also possible to add own format matchers there.

### Format matchers

~~~ yaml
# config/alchemy/config.yml
format_matchers:
  email: !ruby/regexp '/\A[^@\s]+@([^@\s]+\.)+[^@\s]+\z/'
  url: !ruby/regexp '/\A[a-z0-9]+([\-\.]{1}[a-z0-9]+)*\.[a-z]{2,5}(:[0-9]{1,5})?(\/.*)?\z/ix'
~~~

### Example

~~~ yaml
- name: person
  ingredients:
    - role: name
      type: Text
      validate:
        - presence: true
    - role: email
      type: Text
      validate:
        - format: email
    - role: homepage
      type: Text
      validate:
        - format: !ruby/regexp '/^[a-z0-9]+([\-\.]{1}[a-z0-9]+)*\.[a-z]{2,5}(:[0-9]{1,5})?(\/.*)?$/']
~~~

The `email` ingredient gets validated against the predefined `email` matcher in the `config.yml`.

The `homepage` ingredient is matched against the given regexp.

### Multiple validations.

Ingredients can have multiple validations.

~~~ yaml
- name: person
  ingredients:
    - role: name
      type: Text
      validate:
        - presence: true
        - uniqueness: true
        - format: name
~~~

The validations are evaluated in the order as they are defined in the list.

At first the name ingredient will be validated for `presence`, then for `uniqueness` and at least against its `format`.

## Assign elements to page layouts

Before you can use elements on pages, you need to define on which page layouts your element can be placed.

So open `config/alchemy/page_layouts.yml` in your text editor and put the name of your new element into the list of available elements for a specific page layout.

~~~ yaml
- name: standard
  elements: [article]
  autogenerate: [article]
~~~

You can now place the article element on each page with page layout `standard`.

All future created pages with page layout `standard` will automatically create the article element for you.

## Generating the partials

After typing the line below in your terminal, the rails generator will create the elements editor and view files.

~~~ bash
bin/rails g alchemy:elements --skip
~~~

The `--skip` flag command skips files that already exist
Without the skip flag, the generator will prompt you about over-writing your element view partials to include the content changes.
The `--force` flag will overwrite your element view partials automatically.

::: tip
You can pass `--template-engine` or `-e` as an argument to use `haml`, `slim` or `erb`.
The default template engine depends on your settings in your Rails host app.
:::

The generator will create partials for each element in your `app/views/alchemy/elements` folder.

According to the first example, the article element, the generator will create the `_article.html.erb` partial.

The generator does not only create these files, it also generates the necessary code for you. Mostly you can take use of the that code and make it nifty by adding some CSS stylings.

## Render elements in your layout

Now that the above 'article' element example is associated with the 'standard' page layout, the element can be rendered on that layout `app/views/alchemy/page_layouts/_standard.html.erb`.

~~~ erb
...
<div class="row">
  <%= render_elements %>
</div>
...
~~~

This renders all elements from current page.

::: tip
Pages must be published for Elements to be associated and rendered.

If you aren't seeing content you created in the admin interface, make sure elements are saved and and you click the "Publish current page content" button from the edit page admin view.
:::

### Render only specific elements

Sometimes you only want to render specific elements on a specific page and maybe exclude some elements.

~~~ erb
<body>
  <header><%= render_elements only: 'header' %></header>

  <main>
    <%= render_elements except: %w(header footer) %>
  </main>

  <footer><%= render_elements only: 'footer' %></footer>
</body>
~~~

### Render elements from other pages

A common use case is to have global pages for header and footer parts:
~~~ yaml
# config/alchemy/elements.yml
- name: header
  hint: Navigation bar at the top of every page
  ingredients:
    # ...

- name: footer
  hint: Footer section at the bottom of every page
  ingredients:
    # ...

# config/alchemy/page_layouts.yml

- name: header
  unique: true
  elements: [header]
  autogenerate: [header]
  layoutpage: true

- name: footer
  unique: true
  elements: [footer]
  autogenerate: [footer]
  layoutpage: true
~~~

Which can be added to your `application.html.erb` file:

~~~ erb
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="<%= @page.language_code %>">
  <head>
    ...
  </head>

  <body>
    <header><%= render_elements from_page: 'header' %></header>

    <main>
      <%= yield %>
    </main>

    <footer><%= render_elements from_page: 'footer' %></footer>

    <%= render "alchemy/edit_mode" %>
  </body>
</html>
~~~

### Render a group of elements on a fixed place on the page

Often you have a separate section on one page (like a sidebar) or a global section to be rendered on every page (like a navbar or footer).

If you configure those elements as `fixed: true` in `elements.yml`, then they'll be separated from the general collection of elements and will be displayed separately in a separate tab in the admin elements section.

~~~ yaml {3}
- name: sidebar
  unique: true
  fixed: true
  ingredients:
    - role: name
      type: Text
      # ...
~~~

You can then access these elements using the `fixed_elements` scope:

~~~ erb
<% @page.fixed_elements.each do |element| %>
  <%= render_element(element) %>
<% end %>
~~~

As `fixed_elements` is an a active record scope you can also filter by `where(name: 'your_element')` or use the `named('your_element')` scope. To gain some extra efficiency from Rails you could also use the collection rendering shortcut

~~~ erb
<%= render @page.fixed_elements.named('sidebar') %>
~~~

::: tip NOTE
You need to use the elements view partial name instead of the element local variable in your child element views. Ie. `sidebar_view` instead of `element`.
:::

## Customizing the view partial

The Alchemy element generator creates the basic html markup for you.

Pretty useful, but maybe not what you need, sometimes. No problem, feel free to customize it. It's yours :).

This is the newer notation for rendering the element's partial:

~~~ erb
<%= element_view_for(element) do |el| %>
  <h3><%= el.render :headline %></h3>
  <div class="row">
    <div class="large-6 columns">
      <p>
        <%= el.render :image %>
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="large-6 columns">
      <p>
        <%= el.render :text %>
      </p>
    </div>
  </div>
<% end %>
~~~

The `element_view_for` helper wraps the inner html code into a `div` element by default. You can pass arguments to the helper to change its rendering behavior:

The second argument `tag` is used for the wrapping html tag. Passing `false` to it means no wrapping at all. Passing the name of any html element to it means the inner html gets wrapped within the given html tag instead of the default `div`.

### Pass options to the element wrapper

You can pass additional arguments to add or change any html attributes of the wrapper.

~~~ erb
<%= element_view_for(element, tag: 'li', class: 'red', id: 'my_unique_id') do |el| %>
  ...
<% end %>
~~~

::: tip
If you want to learn more about the helper methods used in these partials, please have a look at the [Documentation](http://rubydoc.info/search/github/AlchemyCMS/alchemy_cms?q=helper).
:::

### Pass options to the ingredient view

You can pass options to the ingredient view.

~~~ erb
<%= element_view_for(element) do |el| %>
  <%= el.render :image, {size: '200x300'}, class: 'image-large' %>
<% end %>
~~~

::: tip
Instead of passing the `size` of an image into the `EssencePicture` as shown above, you should consider to use static [ingredient settings](ingredients.html#individual-ingredient-settings) instead.
:::

The first hash is the `options` the second one the `html_options` passed to the wrapper of the ingredient.
If you only want to pass `html_options` you need to pass an empty hash as second argument.

~~~ erb
<%= element_view_for(element) do |el| %>
  <%= el.render :image, {}, class: 'image-large' %>
<% end %>
~~~

::: tip
Not all ingredients have wrapper tags. A list of all ingredient views are [here](https://github.com/AlchemyCMS/alchemy_cms/tree/master/app/views/alchemy/ingredients).
:::

## Translating elements

Element and ingredient names are passed through Rails' [I18n](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/i18n.html) library.
You can translate them in your `config/locales` language yml file.

~~~ yaml
de:
  alchemy:
    element_names:
      contact_form: Kontaktformular
      search: Suche
    ingredient_roles:
      headline: Überschrift
~~~

Content names can also be translated related to their element.
This is useful for ingredients with the same name that should have different translations.

~~~ yaml
de:
  alchemy:
    element_names:
      contact_form: Kontaktformular
    ingredient_roles:
      color: Farbe
      contact_form:
        color: Button Farbe
~~~

### Re-arranging Elements on a Page

Collapsed elements can be re-arranged by clicking and dragging the its icon to the left of the element title.

You can't re-arrange an expanded element, you need to collapse it first.

### Using the Clipboard

The clipboard receives elements that are copied or cut. The most prominent use-case is to copy or move elements from one page to another.

You can use the icons to copy and cut a specific element from its expanded state.

You can view the contents of the clipboard using the icon at the top of the elements bar.

When adding a new top-level element, the "Paste from clipboard" tab will be visible if the clipboard is storing any elements.


## Deprecating an element

Occasionally, an element needs to be removed, either because it is no
longer in use or is being replaced by another.
Alchemy provides a straightforward deprecation system to notify editors of such changes.

### Mark an element as deprecated

Add `deprecated: true` to the element definition to mark it as deprecated:
~~~ yaml
- name: hero_carousel_element
  deprecated: true
~~~

By default, a deprecation notice will be displayed with the following message:

```WARNING! This element is deprecated and will be removed soon. Please do not use it anymore.```


Alternatively, you can provide a custom message for a specific element by passing a string:
~~~ yaml
- name: hero_carousel_element
  deprecated: Hero Carousel will is obsolete and be removed very soon. Please use basic_carousel instead
~~~

### Customizing Deprecation Notices
You can customize deprecation messages in your i18n files:

#### Element-Specific Notices
Define a specific notice for an individual element by name:
~~~ yaml
en:
  alchemy:
    element_deprecation_notices:
      hero_carousel_element: Hero carousel will be removed very soon. Don't use anymore ;-)
~~~

#### Global Notice
Modify the general deprecation notice applied to all elements:
~~~ yaml
en:
  alchemy:
    element_deprecation_notice: This element is obsolete and will be removed very soon.
~~~
