h2. Elements

Elements are customizable parts of your page. An article with headline, text block and a picture is a typically element.

An element contains one or more contents of a specific essences type.
There are "essence types":essences.html for every type of data that can be stored in a database.

h3. Defining elements

Elements get defined in the <code>config/alchemy/elements.yml</code> file.

Run the scaffold generator to create the file:

<shell>
rails g alchemy:scaffold
</shell>

Please read the "guide for creating elements":create_elements.html for further information on the syntax.

h3. Element views

Every element has to view partials.

# The element's view file (ie: <code>_article_view.html.erb</code>) gets rendered when a user requests your webpage.
# The element's editor file (ie: <code>_article_editor.html.erb</code>) gets rendered when you edit the page in the Alchemy page editor.

NOTE: If you want to know more about the helper methods used in these partials, please have a look at the "Documentation":http://rubydoc.info/search/github/magiclabs/alchemy_cms?q=helper.

Now is a good time to read the "guide for creating elements":create_elements.html.
