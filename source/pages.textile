h2. Pages

Pages are organized as tree and represent your navigation.

Pages *do not hold the actual content*. The actual content is stored in the "essences":essences.html from the elements of that page.

Besides a language, a Page has attributes for names, the visibility, the public status, restriction and all SEO relevant attributes, like meta tags and meta descriptions.

Every Page has a "page_layout":page_layouts.html which is also defined with properties (caching, uniqueness, feed, ...) and has "elements":elements.html and "cells":cells.html.

h3. Global pages

Global pages (or layout pages) are pages that are not in the default page tree (your navigation). Use them to store elements, that you render on other pages (ie. sidebars, footer, header, etc) or on the application layout.

To define a global page set <code>layoutpage: true</code> in the page layout definition of that page.

h4. Render an element from a global page

To render an element from a global page use the from_page option of the <code>render_elements</code> helper.

Example:


<pre>
<%= render_elements only: 'news_teaser', from_page: 'sidebar' %>
</pre>
