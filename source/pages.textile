h3. Page structure

Pages are structured with the "awesome_nested_set":https://github.com/collectiveidea/awesome_nested_set in language-trees.
Beside the language, a Page has attributes for naming, visibility, publicity, restriction, locking and seo.

Every Page has a "page-layout":page_layouts.html which is also defined with properties (caching, uniqueness, controller, feed, ...) and relations to 
"elements":elements.html and "cells":cells.html.
