h3. What are Cells?

Cells are sections on a page and are acting as containers for elements.

Cells are defined here: <code>/config/alchemy/cells.yml</code>

*Example*

<pre>
- name: left_column
  elements: [image, text]
</pre>

Normally cells are rendered on page_layouts. They can be called with this helper method:

<pre>
render_cell(:cellname)
</pre>
