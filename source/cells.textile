h2. Cells

Cells are sections on a page and are acting as containers for elements.

h3. Defining cells

Cells are defined here:

<code>config/alchemy/cells.yml</code>

You also have to define the cells to use in your <code>config/alchemy/page_layouts.yml</code>

Please be aware: You can only add elements that are both defined in your cells.yml and page_layouts.yml!

h4. Example

cells.yml

<yaml>
- name: left_column
  elements: [image, text]
</yaml>

page_layouts.yml

<yaml>
- name: standard
  cells: left_column
  elements: [image, text]
</yaml>

Normally cells are rendered on page_layouts. They can be called with this helper method:

<erb>
<%= render_cell(:cellname) %>
</erb>

If you render cells like this, an additional view-partial is rendered, naming scheme is <code>/app/views/alchemy/cells/_left_column.html.erb</code>

In this partial use <code><%= render_elements :from_cell => 'left_column' %></code> to render cell-related elements only.
