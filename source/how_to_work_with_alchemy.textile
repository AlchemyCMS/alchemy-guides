h3. Conceptual page and content structuring

When working with Alchemy CMS the very first thing the webdeveloper conceptually does is splitting the website´s layout into different types (called page-layouts).
Every page which is structurally different to other, should get its own page-layout. A page-layout is a html template with specified properties.

After that the developer will look deeper to the content and will perhaps split the pages into cells.
Cells can be rendered on page-layouts and are acting as containers for elements.

In any case the developer splits the content into elements. That means grouping the smallest parts of the website (the contents).
Elements are containers for essences (called contents) and can be rendered on page-layouts or in cells.

A content is the smallest part in Alchemy and refers to one of the essence-types Alchemy CMS provides (EssenceText, EssencePicure, EssenceRichtext, ...).
