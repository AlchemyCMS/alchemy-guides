h2. Image processing

Alchemy uses RMagick (the Ruby ImageMagick library) and Fleximage (a powerful image processing template language) to render images.

Images are stored as master images in the pictury library. The editor just assigns these master images to content elements you provide. You also set the image rendering bounderies. The max width and heigth values, or even the size an image should be cropped to. Alchemy even comes with a fancy Javascript based image cropper tool, so that your customer can define the mask to be used.
