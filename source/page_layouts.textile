h2. Page layouts (templates)

endprologue.

h3. What are page layouts?

Page layouts are templates for pages in Alchemy CMS.

Every page depends on a page_layout.

Alchemy CMS parses the <code>/config/alchemy/page_layouts.yml</code> file which defines all the available page layouts in the application.

h3. How do they work?

In the <code>/app/views/layouts</code> folder of your rails project, Alchemy CMS first looks for the <code>application.html.erb</code> layout and if that's not present it looks for a file named <code>pages.html.erb</code> and renders it.

Page layouts are templates (view partials) which are yielded on the <code>pages.html.erb</code> template.
They are being parsed through ERB, so you can write HTML/CSS and execute ruby code there.

If no page_layout partial is found, the "_standard.html.erb" file gets rendered.

If using the caching option (defined in <code>/config/alchemy/config.yml</code>), your page_layouts will be cached for fast delivering. (action_caching)

You can "create your own page layouts":create_own_page_layouts.html which can be chosen by the user in the backend when creating a new page.
