h3. What are page layouts?

Every page in Alchemy has a page layout.

Think of page layout as types of pages. They are used to define page abilities, like available elements, caching settings, enabling xml feeds, and so on.

Page layouts are defined in the <code>config/alchemy/page_layouts.yml</code> file.

h3. How do they work?

When creating a page the user gets prompted to select a page layout. Depending on that page layouts configuration the user has elements to manage content with.

h3. Rendering

Page layouts are Rails view partials which are yielded on the template. They are being parsed through ERB, so you can write HTML/CSS and execute Ruby code there.

You can find all page layout partials in the <code>app/views/alchemy/page_layouts</code> folder.

They are named after the page layout's name you defined in the <code>page_layouts.yml</code> file.

If no page layout partial is found, the <code>_standard.html.erb</code> file gets rendered.

INFO: Alchemy comes with generator that creates the partials for you.<br>
Run <code>rails g alchemy:page_layouts --skip</code> inside you terminal.

h3. Caching

If using the caching option (defined in <code>config/alchemy/config.yml</code>), your page layouts will be cached for fast delivering through Rails action caching.

INFO: You can disable the caching of a page in the <code>page_layouts.yml</code> file with the<br>
<code>cache: false</code> option.
