h2. Configuration of Alchemy CMS

Alchemy configuration is done in the <code>config/alchemy/config.yml</code> file.

Use <code>rake alchemy:install</code> or <code>rails g alchemy:scaffold</code> to generate it.

h3. The configuration file

Please "have a look into the source code":https://raw.github.com/magiclabs/alchemy_cms/3.0-stable/config/alchemy/config.yml
The file is pretty well documentated and much more up to date then this guide.

h3. Environment related configurations

Beside using that one configuration file you also can seperate certain config settings for specific environments.

For example: You want to enforce SSL in production, while in your development environment you don't.

Its easy to achieve by setting up a second configuration file for development which contains nothing but the ssl enforcing setting.

Your apps default config:
<code>your_app/config/alchemy/config.yml</code>

Environment specific config:
<code>your_app/config/alchemy/development.config.yml</code>

When running your application in development mode both config files get merged, while the environment specific config takes precedence over the default config.
