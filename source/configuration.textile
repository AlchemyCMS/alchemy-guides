endprologue.

h3. The configuration file

Please have a look into "the source code":https://raw.github.com/magiclabs/alchemy_cms/2.7-stable/config/alchemy/config.yml .
The file is pretty well documentated and much more up to date then this guide. This may help you to set up your project properly.

h3. Routing

During the installation of Alchemy CMS you choosed the mount directory.

If you like to define special routes , open the routes.rb in <code>config/</code>
and add your routes.

It might look like this,
e.g. sets the root path to <code>/blog</code>:

<pre>
root to: redirect('/blog')
mount Alchemy::Engine => '/'
...
</pre>

NOTE! Please make sure to add your custom routes above <code>mount Alchemy:Engine => "/"</code>, otherwise they won't be used.
