h3. Essence types

h4. EssenceText

Used to store a String (max. 255 Chars.) i.e. a headline, or productname. The editor is renderd as a single-lined input field. The view output will be sanitized and escaped. So it's XSS save.

h4. EssenceRichtext

Used to store editable richtext. Editor is rendered as a textarea with TinyMCE Editor.

h4. EssencePicture

Used to store picture ids from pictures assigned through the library. The editor is rendered as a picture-editor collection with a lot of options (i.e. image cropper). The view renders the assigned picture, resizes it, crops it and caches the result.

h4. EssenceFlash

Used to store attachment ids from attachments assigned through the library. The view renders an embeded object.

h4. EssenceDate

Used to store a DateTime object. The view output is passed through Rails I18n Library, so it will be fully localized.

h4. EssenceHtml

Used to store html code (i.e. a YouTube video embed code). The view output renders the raw, not sanitized or unescaped String. So be careful!

INFO: Its easy to add more Essence-types to Alchemy. More information here in this guide: "Creating own Essence-types":creating_own_essence_types.html
