This guide explains Alchemy´s flexible architecture.

h3. Rails Engine

Since the Alchemy CMS project started, it is a rails engine.
Rails 3.1 brought the possibility for namespacing and mounting of rails-engines.
Since Alchemy CMS v2.1 it is now a mountable and completely namespaced rails-engine.

h3. Stored data-formats

Alchemy CMS stores ids, unformatted text and only some richtext content in the database.<br />
No markup (beside basic text formatting inside the richtext elements), no styling, no layout.

h3. Rendering process

When rendering a Page through the pages_controller´s show method, the pages.html.erb view will be used.
This view is yielding the corresponding page_layout partial which renders the cells and elements.

h3. Caching

If not deactivated in the "configuration":configuration.html, Alchemy CMS uses action-caching for fast content delivering.
This will cache the "page-layout":page_layouts.html partials where "cells":cells.html and "elements":elements.html are rendered on.
