endprologue.



h3. Prerequisites

We assume that you already have ordered a hostingplan on RailsHoster.

If not please go to "railshoster.com":http://www.railshoster.com/web_hosting and choose a plan that suites your needs.

INFO: Alchemy runs with all plans, even the smallest one starting a only â‚¬ 4,95.



h3. Install the railshoster gem

<shell>
$ gem install railshoster
</shell>



h3. Create a remote git repo

Create a new repository on "GitHub":https://github.com or, if you have one, into your own Gitolite/Gitosis server or where ever you have your git remote repositories.

TIP: DO NOT EVER STORE ANY CRITICAL INFORMATIONS, LIKE DATABASE OR SSH PASSWORDS INTO YOUR GIT REPOSITORY, UNLESS YOU HAVE A PRIVATE ONE!<br>
Remember: GitHub repositories from the free plan are open to the public.

h4. Init your project as git repository

Inside your projects folder enter:

<shell>
git init .
</shell>

Open the <code>.gitignore</code> file in your editor and add:

<pre>
index/**/*
uploads/**/*
</pre>

TIP: You can pass <code>--scm=git</code> option to the Alchemy installer while creating a new project. That option inits your project as git repository and sets all ignores for you.

h4. Add the remote repository

h5. GitHub Example

<shell>
git remote add origin git@github.com:repository-name.git
</shell>

h5. Repository server with a non standard ssh port

<shell>
git remote add origin ssh://git@your-reposerver.de:SSHPORT/repository-name.git
</shell>



h3. Initialize your project for railshoster

<shell>
railshoster init -a YOUR_APP_KEY .
</shell>

NOTE: You received your app key for your rails app with your order confirmation from railshoster.



h3. Add Alchemy and Rails 3.1 deploy tasks

Open the <code>config/deploy.rb</code> file with an editor and add:

<pre>
require 'alchemy/capistrano'
load 'deploy/assets'
</pre>

h4. If your repository server has a non standard ssh port

Change

<code>set :repository, "git@your-reposerver.de/repository-name.git"</code>

to

<code>set :repository, "ssh://git@your-reposerver.de:SSHPORT/repository-name.git"</code>



h3. Commit and push deploy settings

<shell>
$ git commit -am 'Added deploy settings'
$ git push origin master
</shell>



h3. Run the setup task

<shell>
railshoster deploy:setup
</shell>

NOTE: If prompted, enter the mount point of Alchemy to the same you have in your <code>config/routes.rb</code> file.



h3. Make your first cold deploy

<shell>
railshoster deploy:cold
</shell>



TIP: Sometimes the ssh-key forwarding does not work. If the deploy script wants you to enter a password for the repository server then something is wrong with the key forwarding. "RailsHoster has a guide":http://help.railshoster.com/kb/getting-started/showcase-deploy-an-alchemy-cms-site-using-the-railshoster-gem how to fix this in their knowledge base.



h3. Check the installation

Open a browser and enter the domain the railshoster gem just showed you after succesfull deploy.

TIP: You can always get your domain via the railshoster gem. Just run <code>railshoster appurl</code> while in your sites folder.



h3. Next steps

Now you can start to customize your Alchemy site.

Just follow one of our "guides":/.

Everytime you have made a change you want to publish onto your server just run:

<shell>
railshoster deploy
</shell>
