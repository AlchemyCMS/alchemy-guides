h3. Guide Assumptions

This guide is designed for beginners who want to get started with a Alchemy CMS site from scratch. It does not assume that you have any prior experience with Alchemy. However, to get the most out of it, you need to have some prerequisites installed:

* The "Ruby":http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads programming language
* The "MySQL Database":http://www.mysql.com/downloads/mysql
* The image processor "ImageMagick":http://www.imagemagick.org/script/install-source.php

Alchemy is a Ruby On Rails based web software.

Never heard of it? Many popular websites and web-apps are powered by Ruby On Rails. Some popular examples are: Xing, Groupon, Qype, Shopify and many more.

Installing Rails on your computer and/or server is easy. There are some good free resources on the Internet for learning Rails, including:

* "Try Ruby":http://tryruby.org
* "Getting Started with Rails":http://guides.rubyonrails.org/getting_started.html
* "Rails for Zombies":http://railsforzombies.org/labs

h3. What is Alchemy CMS?

Alchemy, is an open source content management system written in Ruby as a Ruby on Rails web application with jQuery and jQueryUI used as the JavaScript library.

Alchemy runs on Rails >= 2.3 including Rails 3.0

h4. Alchemy's architecture

Alchemy is a Rails Engine that acts like a mini Rails application with its own controllers, models, routes and views.

Alchemy is architected like this so that it keeps out of the way of any custom development you will do in your +./app+ directory.

Alchemy itself depends on other Gems. The full list of dependencies is "listed here":https://github.com/magiclabs/alchemy_cms

NOTE: You do not have to install all the dependencies yourself. Alchemy has an installer to do that for you.

h3. Creating a new Alchemy project

Alchemy runs under both Rails 2.3 and Rails 3 environment.

Because these two Rails versions are completly different in how they are running a Rails engine you have to install Alchemy in different ways.

We'll show you both.

h4. Rails 2.3

Please make sure that the latest Rails 2.3 version is installed:

<shell>
gem install rails -v=2.3.14
</shell>

The easiest way to create a new Alchemy project is to use the "install script":https://raw.github.com/magiclabs/alchemy-installer/master/alchemy we provide.
Download the installer and put it in an executable folder of your choice (I.E.: +/usr/local/bin+).

Then go to your web projects folder and enter:

<shell>
alchemy new YOUR_APP_NAME
</shell>

NOTE: Please use your projects name instead of YOUR_APP_NAME

INFO: This step may take some time to load as it needs to download and install all the ruby gems and plugins Alchemy depends on. The installer will ask you some questions about your local development invironment. Just follow the instructions.

h4. Rails 3.0.x (beta)

Just install the latest pre release version of the Alchemy 2.0 Gem (A Ruby package):

<shell>
gem install alchemy_cms --pre
</shell>

Alchemy 2.0 comes with it's own executable which makes it easy to install a new project:

<shell>alchemy new my_magicpage</shell>

NOTE: Please change my_magicpage with your projects name. Since my_magicpage is just a placeholder.

Sit back and follow the on screen instructions. After a view seconds your Alchemy project is installed and ready to start.

h3. Welcome to Alchemy!

Now that you have Alchemy installed, let's start with adding your first administrator.

h4. Starting up the Server

To start using Alchemy, you need to start up a local ruby server on your development machine.

<shell>
cd into_your_alchemy_project_folder
</shell>

h5. Rails 2:

<shell>script/server</shell>

h5. Rails 3:

<shell>rails server</shell>

TIP: To stop the web server, hit CTRL+C in the terminal window where it's running.

Open a browser window and navigate to "http://localhost:3000":http://localhost:3000.

You should be greeted with a screen prompting you to create your first Alchemy administrator.
