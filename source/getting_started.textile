endprologue.

h3. Guide Assumptions

This guide is designed for beginners who want to get started with a Alchemy CMS site from scratch. It does not assume that you have any prior experience with Alchemy. However, to get the most out of it, you need to have some prerequisites installed:

* The "Ruby":http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads language version 1.8.7*
* The "MySQL Database":http://www.mysql.com/downloads/mysql
* The image processor "ImageMagick":http://www.imagemagick.org/script/install-source.php

INFO: *) Alchemy depends on some gems that are not supporting Ruby 1.9 for now.

Alchemy is a Ruby On Rails based web software.

Never heard of it? Many popular websites and web-apps are powered by Ruby On Rails. Some popular examples are: Xing, Groupon, Qype, Shopify and many more.

Installing Rails on your computer and/or server is easy. There are some good free resources on the Internet for learning Rails, including:

* "Getting Started with Rails":http://guides.rubyonrails.org/getting_started.html
* "Rails for Zombies":http://railsforzombies.org/labs

h3. What is Alchemy CMS?

Alchemy, is an open source content management system written in Ruby as a Ruby on Rails web application with jQuery and jQueryUI used as the JavaScript library.

Alchemy runs on Rails >= 2.3 including Rails 3.0.x

h4. Alchemy's architecture

Alchemy is a Rails Engine that acts like a mini Rails application with its own controllers, models, routes and views.

Alchemy is architected like this so that it keeps out of the way of any custom development you will do in your +./app+ directory.

Alchemy itself depends on other Gems. The full list of dependencies is "listed here":https://github.com/magiclabs/alchemy

NOTE: You do not have to install all the dependencies yourself. Alchemy has an installer to do that for you.

h3. Creating a new Alchemy project

Alchemy runs under both Rails 2.3 and Rails 3 environment.

Because these two Rails versions are completly different in how they are running a Rails engine you have to install Alchemy in different ways.

We'll show you both.

h4. Rails 2.3

Please make sure that Rails 2.3.10 is installed:

<shell>
gem install rails -v=2.3.10
</shell>

The easiest way to create a new Alchemy project is to use the "install script":https://raw.github.com/magiclabs/alchemy-installer/master/alchemy we provide.
Download the installer and put it in an executable folder of your choice (I.E.: +/usr/local/bin+).

Then go to your web projects folder and enter:

<shell>
alchemy new YOUR_APP_NAME
</shell>

NOTE: Please use your projects name instead of YOUR_APP_NAME

INFO: This step may take some time to load as it needs to download and install all the ruby gems and plugins Alchemy depends on. The installer will ask you some questions about your local development invironment. Just follow the instructions.

h4. Rails 3.0.x (beta)

Please make sure you have at least Rails 3.0.9 installed:

<shell>
gem install rails -v='~>3.0.9'
</shell>

INFO: Rails 3.1 is not yet supported.

Make yourself a new rails 3 app with MySQL as database:

<shell>rails new my_magicpage -d mysql</shell>

INFO: Other databases should also work, but are NOT tested.

NOTE: Please change my_magicpage with your projects name. Since my_magicpage is just a placeholder.

The following steps all happen inside your projects folder. So please change into it:

<shell>cd my_magicpage</shell>

Open the file +Gemfile+ in a texteditor of your choice and insert this line:

<shell>gem 'alchemy', '2.0.pre', :git => 'git://github.com/magiclabs/alchemy.git', :branch => 'rails3'</shell>

INFO: Because Alchemy's master branch is supporting Rails 2.3 only be sure that the branch option points to rails3 branch.

Install the bundle:

<shell>bundle install</shell>

Then run these commands:

<shell>rake db:create
rake db:migrate:alchemy
rake alchemy:assets:copy:all
</shell>

Open +db/seeds.rb+ in a texteditor and insert this line:

<shell>Alchemy::Seeder.seed!</shell>

Seed your database:

<shell>rake db:seed</shell>

Done!

INFO: We will provide an executable with the stable version of this gem, so you do not have to enter all this stuff into the terminal.

h3. Welcome to Alchemy!

Now that you have Alchemy installed, let's start with adding your first administrator.

h4. Starting up the Server

To start using Alchemy, you need to start up a local ruby server on your development machine.

You do this by running:

<shell>
./script/server
</shell>

NOTE: To fire up the server you have to be inside your projects folder. So maybe you have to first +cd+ into it!

TIP: To stop the web server, hit Ctrl+C in the terminal window where it's running.

Open a browser window and navigate to "http://localhost:3000/admin":http://localhost:3000/admin.

You should be greeted with a screen prompting you to create your first Alchemy administrator.

*If you see this screen it means you have setup everything correctly and your Alchemy CMS site is up and running.*

h5. Now fill out the form to create your first admin user

Once you've created your first user you'll see Alchemy's Homescreen.

NOTE: We are giving you just a quick overview here. In depth guides for each module are covered seperatly.

h4. Sitemap

The Sitemap provides management of pages and their content.

The pages are your website pages organized in a tree structure.

This tree structure represents your websites navigation.

h4. Archive

The Archive is your websites asset storage. You hold images, file, documents, videos, etc. inside the archive and share them across your website.

h5. Imagearchive

Alchemy does some real magic (Imagemagick) with them. You just upload an image once. Regardless of the size and cropping the image will have later on your website.
