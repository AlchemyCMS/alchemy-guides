h2. Page layouts (templates)

endprologue.

h3. What are page layouts?

Page layouts are templates for pages in Alchemy CMS.

Every page depends on a page_layout.

Alchemy CMS parses the <code>/config/alchemy/page_layouts.yml</code> file which defines all the available page layouts in the application.

h3. How do they work?

In the <code>/app/views/layouts</code> folder of your rails project, Alchemy CMS looks for a file named <code>pages.html.erb</code> â€“ and if its found, it will be rendered.

This means, every page in Alchemy CMS will be rendered with this template. But it would be sad if you could have just one template, so Alchemy provides page layouts!

Page layouts are templates which are yielded on the <code>pages.html.erb</code> template.
They are being parsed by ERB, so you can write HTML/CSS and execute ruby code there.

If using the page-caching option which is defined in <code>/config/alchemy/config.yml</code>, your page_layouts will be cached for fast delivering.

Of course you dont want to use the standard-set layout for every website. You will then have to create your own page layouts (templates) which can be chosen by the user in the backend when creating a new page.
