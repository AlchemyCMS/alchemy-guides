h3. How Alchemy organizes websites

When working with Alchemy CMS a webdeveloper splits a website into its different page-layouts, perhaps in cells but in any case he groups contents to elements.

Every page in Alchemy is based on a page-layout.
A page-layout is a html template with specified properties.

Cells can be rendered on page-layouts and are acting as containers for elements.

Elements are containers for essences (called contents) and can be rendered on page-layouts or in cells.
